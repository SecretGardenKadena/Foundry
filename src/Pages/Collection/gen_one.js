                    The Secret Garden of Kadena is hidden deep in a lost cave. 
                    The gnomes discovered this mystical place and have devoted their lives to 
                    protecting it. For their good deeds, the garden has accepted them, but the 
                    gnomes know itâ€™s only a matter of time before they have to defend it. 
                    SGK is a multi-game and NFT project building on Kadena and running on FLUX. 
                    SGK is building incredibly fun games from the most popular gaming genres.
